# Sales Performance Analysis – Power BI Project

## 👋 About This Project
This is an end-to-end **Sales Analysis Dashboard** that I built in Power BI.  
The goal was to explore a sales dataset and answer common business questions around revenue, profit, discounts, and customer purchase patterns.

This report gives a clear picture of:
- What’s selling well (and what isn’t)
- How sales change over time
- Which products or cities bring the most value
- How discounts impact profit
- Order-level insights for deeper analysis

## 🎯 What This Dashboard Can Answer

Here are the exact questions I designed the report for:

1. **Top/Bottom 5 products** based on **Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold**
2. How **sales trends** change over time (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
3. Relationship between **Sales & Profit**
4. Compare **two time periods** (ex: this month vs last month)
5. Average **discount** offered in each category
6. **Total number of orders**
7. Order-level view showing Sales, Profit, Discount, Net Sales, and more  
   (with filters for Product, Date, Customer ID, Promotion Category)
8. Sales performance **across different cities**

## 📂 Dataset (Simple Explanation)
The dataset contains order-level sales information.  
Some important fields include:

- Order Date  
- Product Name / Product ID  
- Customer ID  
- City  
- Quantity Sold  
- Sales & Profit  
- Discounts  
- Promotion / Discount Category  

I cleaned and transformed the data in **Power Query**, built a star-schema data model, and created DAX measures for all key KPIs.
